# SLIC-segmentation-CUDA

Simple Linear Iterative Clustering segmentation algorithm developed with CUDA compatibility.
This project was done only by using OpenCV and CUDA standard libraries.
It can segment superpixels of a given video stream.

Requirements,
  * CUDA enabled GPU (I've used Nvidia GeForce GTX1050)
  * OpenCV (I've used version 4.4.0) 
  * CUDA installed (I've used version 10.2 and 11.0)
  * Updated Nvidia drivers

The Project was created with Microsoft Visual studio 2017.
This repository contains only the source file of this project.
All the Host and Device codes are included in "kernel.cu" file.
Add the source file into your project and set the project properties according to your system settings.
Any suggestions and upgrades are much appreciated.

Thank you!
